# Employee Salary Prediction with Machine Learning

This project forecasts whether an employee makes above $50K per year based on the UCI Adult Income dataset. It is comparing the performance of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms.

## Dataset
- **Source**: UCI Adult Income Dataset
- **Features**: Education, Age, Occupation, Hours-per-week.
- **Target**: Income (<=50K or >50K)

## Methods Used
- Data Preprocessing
- Label Encoding and Feature Scaling
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Accuracy and Confusion Matrix Evaluation

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-salary-prediction-ml.git
cd employee-salary-prediction-ml
